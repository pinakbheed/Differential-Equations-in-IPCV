pruebab100out.pgm :- lambda - 100
pruebab150out.pgm :- lambda - 150
pruebab200out.pgm :- lambda - 200

Problem 3 Solution
a) Computation time for ced_fed is less than ced. No noticeable differences are seen for short diffusion times. For longer diffusion time,
few differences are seen. Then, edges are preserved more in ced_fed than ced.

b) We notice that there are some differences for M=1. These differences decrease as M increases and the two images are indistinguishable for
M=10 and larger.

Problem 4 Solution
a) For the given image, diffusion time increases as contrast parameter increases. Similarly, the image quality increases for larger lambda.
