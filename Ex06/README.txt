Problem 4 Solution

out1.pgm -> timestep = 0.1 iterations = 200
out2.pgm -> timestep = 0.1 iterations = 200 alpha = 2000

b) We choose no of iterations based on the details need to be preserved.

c) Alpha is choosen high because we need to give more weight to diffusion term/

d) Variational methods preserves more edges than pure diffusion, due to the fact that we try to find an optimal solution. Whereas pure
diffusion is not edge preserving.
